# Actions file for clifm #
######################

# Define here your custom actions. Actions are custom command names
# bound to an executable file located either in DATADIR/clifm/plugins
# (usually /usr/local/share/clifm/plugins) or in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/plugins (usually ~/.config/clifm/plugins).
# Actions can be executed directly from clifm command line, as if they
# were any other command, and the associated file will be executed
# instead. All parameters passed to the action command will be passed
# to the corresponding plugin as well.
